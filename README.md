### FAQ (Feasibly Askable Questions) ~~(nobody's asked me anything about this ._.)~~
**Q**: So the main gimmick is just Jokers That Am OCs?  
**A**: Mainly! I'll also put in canon characters if I feel like it.

**Q**: What power level is this mod planned to be?  
**A**: There will be potential for computer-breaking numbers, probably. Eventually. Once I implement the Jokers involved, and also a reasonable-ish way to acquire them.

**Q**: Is this trying to just be [a certain prior, defunct project] again?  
**A**: ... Not *just*, no... ~~this one's got MY ocs in it!~~ Egotism aside, as much as Bibliography is both inspired by and modeled on [that older project], it's inherently a different mod and will be its own experience. Just for starters, we're going to have different design principles. I'll probably use less xChips than they did, for example.

**Q**: How many Jokers do you plan to add?  
**A**: I plan to keep putting in Jokers until I run out of characters that I can come up with an idea for. ... I'd like at least 70 before then, but I suppose that's up to my creativity. 

**Q**: How many Jokers do you _actually_ have?  
**A**: *(comically long pause for audio splicing)* 5 *(comically long pause for audio splicing)* at the moment, unless I forgot to update this README file, which will definitely happen at some point.

**Q**: ... Are you accepting suggestions for characters to Jokerfy?  
**A**: Sure, if you're accepting that there's no timeline on when I get around to actually implementing a given suggestion.
