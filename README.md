### FAQ (Feasibly Askable Questions) ~~(nobody's asked me anything about this ._.)~~
**Q**: So the main gimmick is just Jokers What Am OCs?  
**A**: Mainly! I'll also put in canon characters if I feel like it.

**Q**: What power level is this mod planned to be?  
**A**: There will be potential for computer-breaking numbers, probably. Eventually. Once I implement the Jokers involved, and also a reasonable-ish way to acquire them.

**Q**: Is this trying to just be [a certain prior project] again?  
**A**: ... Not *just*, no... ~~this one's got MY ocs in it!~~ Egotism aside, as much as Bibliography is both inspired by and modeled on [that older project], it's inherently a different mod and will be its own experience. Just for starters, we're going to have different design principles. I'll probably use less xChips than they did, for example.  
... also now that [that project] is publicly-ish available again, anyone who wants to play it can just play it, so I _gotta_ differentiate myself now :V

**Q**: How many Jokers do you plan to add?  
**A**: I plan to keep putting in Jokers until I run out of characters that I can come up with an in-game effect for. ... I'd like at least 70 before then, but I suppose that's up to my creativity. 

**Q**: How many Jokers do you _actually_ have?  
**A**: *(comically long pause for audio splicing)* 28, of which 5 are [Fusion Jokers](https://github.com/wingedcatgirl/Fusion-Jokers) exclusive *(comically long pause for audio splicing)* at the moment, unless I forgot to update this README file, which will definitely happen several times throughout the mod's lifespan.

**Q**: ... Are you accepting suggestions for characters to Jokerfy?  
**A**: Sure, if you're accepting that there's no timeline on when I get around to actually implementing a given suggestion. I should probably set up a form or something for this... later.
